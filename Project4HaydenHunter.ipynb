    "**Project Description:**\n",
    "Create a Python class that allows you to interact with a PostgreSQL database for managing student records. The class should provide the following functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a new database in PostgreSQL.** Call the database studentdata. Create a student table with columns studentname, studentid, age, gpa, major. The data for this table is provided. Please look at the data and the column types can be determined from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Upload data.** Upload the data (studentdata.csv) to the student table. This was demonstrated in the PostrgreSQL lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Connect to the Database:** This class method should establish a connection to the PostgreSQL database. The parameters of the method should be the database credentials and server information required to connect to the DB.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Add a New Student Record:** This class method should insert a new row into the student table. The method should be called with the parameters required to add a new row of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **View All Student Records:** This class method should retrieve all student records from the database table and display them to the console/output window.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Calculate average GPA:** This class method should calculate the average gpa of all students in the student table. Print the gpa to the console/output window. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Please make sure each method has exception handling blocks. "
